              <p><b>Overview</b><br/>
             In this course, we were tasked with creating an interactive environment inspired by the book "Starfish" written by Peter Watts. We were not allowed to use any assets that were not created by ourselves or our classmates. I have used sounds and textures made by my classmates, but created all the models on my own.</p>
