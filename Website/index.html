  <h1> Blue Team: a Firewall Setup Game </h1>

      <div class='desc'>
              <p><b>Overview</b><br/>
              Blue Team is an educational security game developed using the Unity engine. The aim of the game is to set up firewall rules, based on the Linux iptables syntax, depending on the network topology, services and logs from IDS (Intrusion Detection System).</p>

              <p><b>Educational Aims</b><br/>
                The educational aims are to teach the players the logic behind setting up firewall rules, some of the basic syntax used, and show examples of what the logs produced by IDS may look like when under attack.</p>

              <p><b>What is a Firewall ?</b><br/>
                Firewall is a network security device that controls what traffic is allowed to enter and/or leave a network. It is usually one of the main tools used to protect a network, and the correctness of its setup can make or break network security. It is therefore important that all users have at least a basic idea about what it does, and how it works.</p>
