  <h1> A basic Raycating program for Computer Graphics Course</h1>

              <p><b>Overview</b><br/>
             During the Computer Graphics course, we were tasked with creating a raycasting program in C++ and OpenGL. We were supplied the basic code, that set up the window and shot the rays, and had to add all of the functionality to actually display things, such as object-ray collision detection and illumination calculations</p> 

              <p><b>Overview</b><br/>
                Due to being a marked coursework, I cannot share the whole code, but one of the main functions can be seen through the link below.
